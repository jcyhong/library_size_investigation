# Library size distributions for grouped microbiome data

## Abstract
In microbiome data analysis, uneven library sizes among observations present great challenges for proper statistical inference. The library size of an observation is the total number of individuals present in the observation. In practice, it is not uncommon for library sizes to vary across several orders of magnitude. On the other hand, observations in microbiome data are often grouped (for example, fecal samples from patients in different treatment groups). The goal of the project is to investigate whether library sizes are typically dependent on the group membership in grouped microbiome data.
